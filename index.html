	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of programs, incompatible Python, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned software.</p>
			<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Program enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="LaunchCode">LC</abbr>, Udacity, and the free learning resources.</p>
			<p>LaunchCode invites you to aspire and learn the important lessons of programming. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with software development.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>There is a continuing need to learn the power of programming. LaunchCode aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing classes in the list. Clicking on any one will lead to a new road for learning.</p>
			<p>LaunchCode allows complete and total control over the way of programming. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by executing code that can truly be awesome, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike contribute to the beauty of software; we can always push it further.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="participation" id="zen-participation" role="article">
			<h3>Participation</h3>
			<p>Strong programming skills has always been our focus. You are modifying your life, so strong programming skills will develop, but the example program files are commented well enough that even programming novices can use them as starting points.</p>
			<p>You may modify the programs in any way you wish, but not the instructions. This may seem daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="benefits" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing programming really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working in programming today, learning aids for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future methods we can all look forward to.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="requirements" id="zen-requirements" role="article">
			<h3>Requirements</h3>
			<p>No experience is necessary, just an eagerness to learn. LaunchCode is about functional, practical programming and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks. The only real requirement we have is that you have the time to commit, and motivation to excel.</p>
			<p>Luckily, programming this way shows how well even beginners can learn to become excellent programmers. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results. Due to the sheer number of resources on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in MOOCs &#8212; pixel-perfect programming may not be possible across every instance. That&#8217;s okay, but do test yourself as many as you can. Your programs should work with as long as effort is put forth.</p>
			<p>We ask that you submit original work. Please respect others. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting programming themes to your work.</p>
			<p>This is a learning journey as well as a demonstration. The program will allow you to demonstrate your programming skills, and in the end showcase them to employers.</p>
